### Authentication Documentation

#### Overview
This Django blog project implements a basic user authentication system, allowing users to:
- Register a new account
- Log in with their credentials
- Log out of their account
- View and update their profile

Each part of the authentication system is described below, along with instructions on how to test the features.

#### 1. **User Registration**
- **URL**: `/register/`
- **Function**: Allows new users to create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Template**: `register.html`
- **Process**: 
  - User fills out the registration form.
  - If the form is valid, the user is created in the database.
  - After registration, the user is redirected to the login page to log in.

##### **Testing User Registration**
1. Navigate to `/register/` in the browser.
2. Fill out the registration form with valid credentials.
3. Check that the user is successfully created and redirected to the login page.

#### 2. **User Login**
- **URL**: `/login/`
- **Function**: Allows users to log in using their registered username and password.
- **Template**: `login.html`
- **Process**: 
  - User enters valid credentials.
  - On successful login, they are redirected to their profile page or another page as needed.

##### **Testing User Login**
1. Navigate to `/login/` in the browser.
2. Log in using the registered credentials.
3. Check that the user is redirected to the profile page (`/profile/`).

#### 3. **User Logout**
- **URL**: `/logout/`
- **Function**: Logs the user out of their account.
- **Template**: None (Redirection after logout).
- **Process**:
  - When the user clicks the logout button, they are logged out and redirected to the homepage.

##### **Testing User Logout**
1. Log in to the account.
2. Click the “Logout” link in the profile page.
3. Confirm that the user is logged out and redirected to the homepage.

#### 4. **User Profile**
- **URL**: `/profile/`
- **Function**: Displays the user’s profile information such as username and email.
- **Template**: `profile.html`
- **Process**: 
  - Users can view their profile information.
  - The profile page is accessible only when logged in.

##### **Testing User Profile**
1. Log in to the account.
2. Navigate to `/profile/`.
3. Check that the user’s profile details (username, email) are displayed correctly.

### How to Test Each Authentication Feature
1. **User Registration**: Test registration by attempting to create accounts with different data, including valid and invalid inputs (e.g., short passwords, existing usernames).
2. **Login**: Test logging in with valid and invalid credentials.
3. **Logout**: After logging in, test logging out and confirm that the session is ended.
4. **Profile**: Test viewing the profile when logged in and confirm that unauthorized users cannot access this page.

### Summary
This documentation covers the implementation and testing of basic authentication features in the Django blog project. It provides a clear guide for users and developers to understand and test the system.
